## Bacteria classification
This project illustrates the implementation of two types of deep network for image classification task: ResNet and EfficientNet. 
The first one, ResNet, was modified via scaling coefficient, corresponding to the number of residual layers in architecture. Changing this hyperparmater in [config file](config.yaml)
